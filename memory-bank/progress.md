### Initial Choices (Week 1)
- **Fastify over Express**: Performance requirements drove this choice
- **Vue.js over React**: Simplicity and rapid development focus
- **SQLite over PostgreSQL**: Development speed and simplicity
  - **Strategic Decision**: SQLite for MVP, TimescaleDB migration planned for scale
- **EJS for SSR**: Simple server-side rendering for initial pages

### Database Evolution Plan
- **Phase 1 (Current)**: SQLite for development and initial deployment
- **Phase 2 (Scale)**: Migrate to TimescaleDB when needed
  - **Migration Scripts**: Ready for automated transition
  - **Performance Threshold**: Monitor concurrent connection limits
  - **Zero Downtime**: Blue-green deployment strategy
