### Why SQLite for Development?
- **Simplicity**: No database server setup required
- **Performance**: Excellent for development and small-scale deployments
- **Portability**: Single file database that's easy to backup/migrate
- **Production Ready**: Can handle moderate loads effectively
- **Migration Ready**: Architecture designed for easy switch to TimescaleDB

### Future Database Migration Plan
**Target: TimescaleDB** (when scaling beyond ~5000 monitors)
- **Timing**: When concurrent monitoring checks exceed SQLite's sweet spot
- **Benefits**: Better time-series performance, horizontal scaling, advanced analytics
- **Migration Strategy**: Gradual migration with data transformation scripts
- **Zero Downtime**: Blue-green deployment approach planned
